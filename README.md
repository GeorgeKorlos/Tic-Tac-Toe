# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python course, specifically designed to practice basic programming concepts. The goal is to create a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Interactive command-line interface
- Validates player moves
- Checks for win conditions and draws
- Option to play again after a game ends

## How It Works

The game uses a 3x3 grid represented as a list of characters. Players take turns entering their moves by selecting a cell on the grid (1-9). The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move and displays the current state of the grid.

### Example Gameplay

- Players take turns entering their moves:
    - Player X selects cell 1
    - Player O selects cell 5
- The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
